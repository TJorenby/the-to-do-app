# the-to-do-app

## Description

_Duration:_Weekend Project

This is a basic ToDo list, where a user can make a checklist of things to do, mark them as complete, and delete entries as needed. 

In building this app, I practiced skills for full stack integration, connecting a jQuery-powered front-end through a node server to a SQL database. 

## Prerequisites 

To run this app, you will need:
    -Node.js
    -Postgres
    
## Install

To run this application:

    - Create a database in Postgres called `weekend-to-do-app`
    - Execute the SQL commands from `database.sql`
    - Run `npm install` from the project root directory
    - Run `npm start` to run the node server
    - Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser

## Usage

Select Task Criteria and click 'Add Task' to create new task
Click 'Complete' to mark task as complete
Click 'Delete Task' to remove task from the list
